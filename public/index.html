    <h2>Who were the Black Panthers</h2>
        <p>The Black Panther Party (BPP) was a revolutionary socialist organization founded in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California. It aimed to challenge police brutality against African Americans and promote social justice.</p>
        <h2>What was their Impact</h2>
        <p>The Black Panther Party (BPP) was founded in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale to fight police brutality and racial injustice in Black communities. They practiced armed self-defense and created community programs like free breakfast for children, health clinics, and education initiatives. Despite facing heavy government opposition, their activism brought national attention to systemic racism and inspired future social justice movements. The BPP’s legacy continues to influence discussions on racial equality, self-determination, and community empowerment today.</p>
        <h2> What is their legacy</h2>
        <p>The Black Panther Party’s legacy lives on through its impact on social justice movements, community activism, and Black empowerment. Their initiatives, like free breakfast programs and health clinics, set a precedent for community-based social services. They also inspired modern movements such as Black Lives Matter, which continues to fight against racial injustice and police brutality. Despite government efforts to dismantle them, the Panthers’ message of self-determination, resistance, and community care continues to influence activism today.</p>
